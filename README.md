# LightBearers

# Welcome to Lucieat Lux Vestra!
Lucieat Lux Vestra (Latin for, “Let Your Light Shine” as used in Matthew Ch. 5 V. 16) is a Roleplaying Game set in an era of Christian persecution. Here you take on the role of the Light Bearers, courageous special agents of the persecuted Christian faith in the Roman Empire. It is a time of great danger, where Christians are viewed with extreme prejudice, and where even the most baseless of charges can lead you to being crucified for your faith.
Yet despite this, His will must be done.

## What am I reading?
Lucheat Lux Vestra is a role-playing game, or RPG. This is a type of game where players take on the role of various heroes that go on thrilling adventures. Lucheat Lux Vestra is different from most other role-playing games in the sense that there are no fantastical elements in the game. Instead, it presents a setting that is rooted in one of the darker chapters of Christian history.
However, Lucheat Lux Vestra is also a great tool for examining your morals and beliefs. As heroes in extraordinary circumstances, the Light Bearers are forced to make difficult choices in the name of their faith. This gives the players insight as to how they would feel if they were to be put into similar (though hopefully less high-stakes!) situations in real life, and gives the group something to reflect upon and discuss in the context of Scripture after the session is over.

## What you need to play?
Unlike board games, Lucheat Lux Vestra does not have a special board or other components. All you need are a copy of this book, some pencils, two decks of playing cards (preferably with different colored backs) and some friends!
Once you’ve got this sorted out, one of you takes the role of the Game Master, or GM. This role is special as they act as the referee and the storyteller in the game. The GM is responsible for narrating the situations, acting out the lines of the other characters and adjudicating the rules. The rest of the players, on the other hand will be making the Light Bearers that work in secret in the Roman Empire to bring His word to those in need.
